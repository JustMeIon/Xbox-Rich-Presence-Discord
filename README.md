# Xbox Rich Presence

*Note: Discord already haves an integrated presence for Xbox Live, but if you want to show more information about what you are playing on Xbox Live you can use this*

***Another note: Please before doing anything read this README, many people tried to clone the repository instead of downloading the release***

## This Rich Presence contains:
1. Game/app name
2. Game/app image (not all games/apps haves an image, you can add images by [contributing](https://github.com/MrCoolAndroid/Xbox-Rich-Presence-Discord#contribute))
3. Timestamp
4. Device name (Xbox One, Xbox 360, etc) and image
5. Xbox Live Rich Presence (if game/app supports it)

## Installation
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/MrCoolAndroid/Xbox-Rich-Presence-Discord/releases) and extract the .zip file to any folder you like, then just run the .exe file (I recommend creating a shortcut on the desktop for quick access). If it asks you to install .NET, you'll need to download it from [here](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/b6fe5f2a-95f4-46f1-9824-f5994f10bc69/db5ec9b47ec877b5276f83a185fdb6a0/windowsdesktop-runtime-5.0.17-win-x86.exe) (x86) or [here](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/3aa4e942-42cd-4bf5-afe7-fc23bd9c69c5/64da54c8864e473c19a7d3de15790418/windowsdesktop-runtime-5.0.17-win-x64.exe) (x64), depending on your system.

2. Go to [OpenXBL](https://xbl.io) and login with your Xbox Live account and you will get an API key, save it on a .txt file

3. Open the app and insert your Gamertag and API key

4. Press Start!
